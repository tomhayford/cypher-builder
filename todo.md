- Relationships can be quantified or variable length, not both
- Patterns can be simple or quantified
- Pattern Pairs 
  - Simple or Quantified
  - Simple can't touch another simple
  - Quantity needs to be at least 1 (simple counts as a 1)

- Nuances of Group Variables
- Where Clauses
  - Inline Nodes
  - Inline Relationships
  - Inline Quantified Patterns

- Graph Patterns
  - Comma Separated list
  - Repeat node refs automatically go without labels and props on any additional repeat

New concepts: 
- Pattern Pairs
- Group Variables
- Pattern Types (simple, quantified)
- Graph Patterns

IDEAS
- Can check previous in pattern to see if its longer than 1.
- Need to specify at pattern start if its simple or quantified. 
- .Pattern
- .PatternPairs(Pattern[])
- .PatternGraph(Pattern[])

 - Simple | Quantified
 - Pairs
 - Graphs

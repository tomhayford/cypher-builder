General todo

-   Check Valid Unions (no simple, simple)
-   Check minimum quantity (at compile or getCypher)
-   Path Variable
-   Group Variables

-   Fix mismatch between Node patterns and node references
    Approach
-   Construct a path by .union instead of .node
-   Need to allow for a Path of paths
-   Need to prevent additional layers

-   Nuances of Group Variables
-   Where Clauses
    -   Inline Nodes
    -   Inline Relationships
    -   Inline Quantified Patterns
-   Graph Patterns
    -   Comma Separated list
    -   Repeat node refs automatically go without labels and props on any additional repeat
